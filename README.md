3. run pip install -f requirements.txt
4. The environment is setup

## Running the replication
Once the pre-requisite is done, just enter python main.py, this will run the experiments. It takes ~1.5 hours to run a single hyperparameter experiment, while the search across all hyperparameters would take a long time
